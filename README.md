# PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES "SENTIMENT ANALYSIS"

## Preface 
For my final project for my Programming Languages class, I am using a python program I created in command-line to analyze subreddits of popular programming languages. The hottest 1000 posts under that subreddit from the past year wil be looked at and analyzed. I am utilizing a sentiment score dictionary called [Loughran-McDonald Master Dictionary w/ Sentiment Word Lists](https://sraf.nd.edu/loughranmcdonald-master-dictionary/) to calculate my scores. Before doing any analysis, I do predict that all of the languages will have positive sentiment scores, but which programming language has the highest score will be discussed in depth for possible reasons why. 

I will also be referring to this ranking below to determine the level of sentiment for each language:
* 0-99: Fairly positive sentiment
* 100-199: Good positive sentiment
* 200-299: Great positive sentiment
* 300+: Amazing positive sentiment.

## Python
In my terminal, I had the following:
```
Enter a subreddit to search for: python
Enter a limit number of posts (1-1000) to search for: 1000
Enter a time (hour, day, week, month, year) to search for: year
Enter a listing (controversial, best, hot, new, random, rising) to search for: hot
SCORE:  358.0
```
The score value of 358 is a pretty high value overall, putting Python in the "Amazing positive sentiment" range. This would make sense since Python is a popular language among data analysts, businesses, and other areas other than pure programming and computer science. In my personal opinion, Python is simple enough to be taught to anyone just starting to learn programming, making it reasonable that it has such a high sentiment score since redditors may love using the language so much in different areas.

## Java
In my terminal, I had the following:
```
Enter a subreddit to search for: java
Enter a limit number of posts (1-1000) to search for: 1000
Enter a time (hour, day, week, month, year) to search for: year
Enter a listing (controversial, best, hot, new, random, rising) to search for: hot
SCORE:  159.0
```
The score value of 159 is a good value overall to have, putting Java in the "Good positive sentiment" range. It shows the positive sentiment redditors have of Java as a programming language. Although I would think it would be much higher, it's possible due to Java being primarily used for pure programmers that others may not use it as much and the subreddit is full of questions and comments rather than positive sentiment.

## C++
In my terminal, I had the following:
```
Enter a subreddit to search for: cpp
Enter a limit number of posts (1-1000) to search for: 1000
Enter a time (hour, day, week, month, year) to search for: year
Enter a listing (controversial, best, hot, new, random, rising) to search for: hot
SCORE:  229.0
```
Surpringsly, C++ has a score of 229, putting the language in the "Great positive sentiment" range. As a language I personally have had difficulties with in the past, having C++ in the "Great" range definitely shows me how redditors think of the language instead. It may be that as a popular language to work with pointers and create data structures in, C++ is amazing at accomplishing what's needed, making its score well deserved if redditors share that sentiment.

## Swift
In my terminal, I had the following:
```
Enter a subreddit to search for: swift
Enter a limit number of posts (1-1000) to search for: 1000
Enter a time (hour, day, week, month, year) to search for: year
Enter a listing (controversial, best, hot, new, random, rising) to search for: hot
SCORE:  123.0
```
Swift's score of 123 puts it in the "Good positive sentiment" range. As a language mostly used on MacOS and for creating IOS applications, I can see why Swift's score is in only the "Good" range. Not everyone who has a Mac will use Swift and the language is fairly new compared to some of the others here so the community for this language isn't as large. The lower sentiment score could stem from posts being about questions and issues rather than positive praise or sentiment for the language.

## Ruby
In my terminal, I had the following:
```
Enter a subreddit to search for: ruby
Enter a limit number of posts (1-1000) to search for: 1000
Enter a time (hour, day, week, month, year) to search for: year
Enter a listing (controversial, best, hot, new, random, rising) to search for: hot
SCORE:  74.0
```
Ruby's score of 74 puts it in the "Fair positive sentiment" range. As a language that I have ony heard once or twice, I do not know the full capabilities and uses of the language, but its low score does reflect the popularity (or lack thereof) of the language. It's interesting to note that Ruby's lower score might not be due to negative sentiment, but the lack of any sentiment.

## JavaScript
In my terminal, I had the following:
```
Enter a subreddit to search for: javascript
Enter a limit number of posts (1-1000) to search for: 1000
Enter a time (hour, day, week, month, year) to search for: year
Enter a listing (controversial, best, hot, new, random, rising) to search for: hot
SCORE:  56.0
```
Extremely surprising, JavaScript's sentiment score of 56 does not reflect its popularity in real life. JavaScript is definitely known for its uses on websites and web applications, so its low sentiment score poses some interesting questions (discussed more below). Why would such a popular language have such a low sentiment score? Is the size of the subreddit community for JavaScript as big as other popular languages such as Java and Python?

## HTML
In my terminal, I had the following:
```
Enter a subreddit to search for: html
Enter a limit number of posts (1-1000) to search for: 1000
Enter a time (hour, day, week, month, year) to search for: year
Enter a listing (controversial, best, hot, new, random, rising) to search for: hot
SCORE:  278.0
```
HTML's score of 278 puts it in the "Great positive sentiment" range, defending its reputation as the popular language for websites and web engineers. Not much can be said right now about HTML without comparison later on but HTML's score definitely reflects its popularity and it's unsuprising to see such a high score.

## SQL
In my terminal, I had the following:
```
Enter a subreddit to search for: sql
Enter a limit number of posts (1-1000) to search for: 1000
Enter a time (hour, day, week, month, year) to search for: year
Enter a listing (controversial, best, hot, new, random, rising) to search for: hot
SCORE:  209.0
```
SQL's score of 209 puts it in the "Great positive sentiment" range. Similarly to HTML, not much can be said without comparison but SQL is a popular language among database programmers and software engineers so a high sentiment score reflects not only popularity but satisfaction of the language's capabilites.

## Rust
In my terminal, I had the following:
```
Enter a subreddit to search for: rust
Enter a limit number of posts (1-1000) to search for: 1000
Enter a time (hour, day, week, month, year) to search for: year
Enter a listing (controversial, best, hot, new, random, rising) to search for: hot
SCORE:  271.0
```
Rust's score of 271 puts it in the "Great positive sentiment" range. I do not know much about Rust but redditors appear to think highly of the language and see it positively.

## Perl
In my terminal, I had the following:
```
Enter a subreddit to search for: perl
Enter a limit number of posts (1-1000) to search for: 1000
Enter a time (hour, day, week, month, year) to search for: year
Enter a listing (controversial, best, hot, new, random, rising) to search for: hot
SCORE:  163.0
```
Perl's score of 163 puts it in the "Good positive sentiment" range. As another language I have never seen or used before, I'm unsure of Perl's functionailites and uses but its "Good" score definitely makes it one of the more better programming languages on this list to redditors.

## Go
In my terminal, I had the following:
```
Enter a subreddit to search for: golang
Enter a limit number of posts (1-1000) to search for: 1000
Enter a time (hour, day, week, month, year) to search for: year
Enter a listing (controversial, best, hot, new, random, rising) to search for: hot
SCORE:  218.0
```
Go's score of 218 puts it in the "Great positive sentiment" range. Go's capabilities and functions definitely gave it a high score since it's popularity is unknown to me. 

## Overall Discussion / Comparison

If we rank the programming languages by their sentiment scores:
1. Python - 358.0
2. HTML - 278.0
3. Rust - 271.0
4. C++ - 229.0
5. Go - 218.0
6. SQL - 209.0
7. Perl - 163.0
8. Java - 159.0
9. Swift - 123.0
10. Ruby - 74.0
11. JavaScript - 56.0

From these results, we can clearly see that Python has the highest sentiment score while JavaScript has the lowest sentiment score. The rest of this discussion section will talk about interesting questions arriving from these results.

### Python as the best programming language? (History + Outside Thoughts)
Python as the "best" programming language on Redditors leads to some interesting thoughts and questions. For example, why is this the case? We can take a look at the history of Python and why it was created and how it appeals to redditors and people in general.

From Python.org, they state that python is an "interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language. It incorporates modules, exceptions, dynamic typing, very high level dynamic data types, and classes. It supports multiple programming paradigms beyond object-oriented programming, such as procedural and functional programming. Python combines remarkable power with very clear syntax. It has interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as to various window systems, and is extensible in C or C++. It is also usable as an extension language for applications that need a programmable interface. Finally, Python is portable: it runs on many Unix variants including Linux and macOS, and on Windows."[^1]

From python.org's description, we can see that Python was created to be clearer and incorporate what other programming languages have in an easy to use syntax and portable programming. This could be appealing to not only programmers but also other disciplines such as business, data analysts, biologists, researchers, etc. Python's versatility makes it so popular with a large community due to its far reaching capabilites. 

From Guido van Rossum's statement, Python was created to fix what Rossum thought the ABC language flawd in. Rossum liked the language design of ABC, such as indentation syntax and high level data types, but did not like how ABC could not be extended to different distributed operating systems.[^1]

The problems with ABC that Rossum described could be a big factor in Python's popularity and high sentiment score. Python as a language can easily be extended to different systems, and it's syntax makes it more accesible to people learning programming due to it's intuitive nature. Python's use in cloud computing, machine learning, and big data also makes it popular in in the data processing business, according SarTia Global's article on LinkedIn.[^2]

By having such a large range of capabilities and uses, redditors definitely see the benefits of python and how utile it is in the technological world. Python's high sentiment score is definitely reasonable and makes considerable sense. 

### JavaScript as the worst programming language? (What happened? + History)
JavaScript as redditor's "worst" programming language is not the first statement that comes to mind when I first think of the language. So why does JavaScript have such a low score? 

If we take a look at the history of JavaScript, the language was created by Brendan Eich in 1995 as a scripting language for Netscape's web browser, Navigator. JavaScripts popularity, however, stems from the fact that its uses could extend to writing browser, server, mobile, and desktop applications, especially over the internet.[^3] From this description, it's intuitive to think JavaScript has a high popularity with the general public, including redditors. However, it's sentiment score says otherwise. 

It's possible that due to JavaScript's usage in mostly online and web applications, it's usage by people is limited to programmers and web engineers who design websites and online applications only. If we compared JavaScript's community with Python and Java, there is a large gap between the former and the latter two. JavaScript has over 2.3 million members in their community while Python has 1.1 million and Java has 280 thousand. So JavaScript's popularity is definitely shown with their community numbers, but the sentiment score reflects redditor's poorer view on JavaScript. Although still positive, it's low number insinuates that JavaScript might not be as positively viewed as Python or Java. 

From DataFlair, JavaScript also has some disadvantages. These include client-side security, varying browser support, lack of debugger, and single inheritance to name a few.[^4] These disadvantages could contribute to redditor's opinion of JavaScript and lower its sentiment score. JavaScript's limit to internet based applications and other aforementioned issues most likely contributed to redditor's poor view of the language, giving an explanation for it's low sentiment score. 

### The Middle Languages (Great Positive Sentiments)
HTML, Rust, C++, Go, and SQL's scores put these languages in the "great" range, but what makes these language great but not as amazing as Python? If we take a look at why rach of the programming languages has the score it has, we can look into the advantages and disadvantages of it and whether the score justifies the reasons.

Starting off with HTML, the programming language has the second highest score, implying it's popularity and positive views on it combined. According to GeeksforGeeks, HTML has many advantages with not as many disadvantages. The disadvantages of HTML include: structure of HTML documents sometimes becomes tough to understand, errors can have large consequences, very time consuming, many lines code for a simple webpage, constant check on the deprecated tags, and limited ecurity features.[^5] These disadvantages make HTML appear like it should not be as popular, but some of these flaws are actually standard flaws for other programming languages as well, such as time consuming or many lines of code. These flaws could be easily fixed with someone who has much patience and time with the language and clever tricks to clean up code. HTML's sentiment score however, reflects a large positive outlook so if we look at the advantages, we might have a better reason for redditor's positivity about the language. Some of the advantages include: ability to build structure of a website, large browser support, fast loading times, simplicity, "easy" to learn and code and loose syntax. From these reasons already, it appears that HTML's uses far exceed the disadvantages.[^5] HTML is used virtually everywhere on the internet on every website, justifying its popularity. It's ease and flexibility also makes it possibly appealing to anyone who wishes to create a website and has patience to learn a few lines of code. In an increasing technologically advancing society, websites are an integral part of our lives as a part of the internet, making HTML one of the most important programming languages. HTML's high sentiment score is definitely justified and redditor's positive outlook on it is reasoned by HTML's many advantages.

Next on the list, Rust is one level under HTML, making it still quite popular as a programming language. As a language I have not used before, I am also curious on why this language has such a high sentiment score. If we take a look at the advantages and disadvantages we could obtain an answer. The advantages of Rust include the fact that it is faster than languages like C/C++, it is multi-purpose language bearing excellent communities, and it has an inbuilt dependency builds management called Cargo, while the disadvantages are that it lacks an efficient garbage collection, it can't develop codes as fast as other programming languages like ruby and python, and the learners might take longer to learn it due to its complexities.[^6] Rust's best advantage appears to be it's efficieny. Being a language faster than C, Rust seems preferable to create programs that need to be processed quickly and have specific memory handling management. This advantage already puts Rust in a positive light, even if one of the disadvantages is a lack of good garbage collection. If a program requires fast execution times, specific memory management, and good code that can already do garbage collection instead of relyingon the compiler, then Rust sounds perfect and even more preferable than C++. This reasoning definitely justifies Rust's high sentiment score. 

The score for C++ puts it right in the middle of the "great" programming languages. If we take a look at C++'s advantages and disadvantages, we can see why it is ranked where it currently is ranked. According to DataFlair again, the advantages of C++ include portability, object-oriented based, low-level mnipulation, memory management, and scalability, while the disadvantages of C++ are pointers, security, and no garbage collector.[^7] As a student who took data structures with C++, I can definitely understand why C++ is ranked in the middle with these advantages and disadvantages. The advantages are definitely great for programmers who need to create programs with many objects and want full control of memory, but it is also difficult to grasp all of memory management ideas such as dealing with pointers and remembering to garbage collect leaked memory. C++ as a language is definitely popular and both equally good and bad in different ways, making its sentiment score justifable. 

Go as a "great" programming language may sound weird to those who have not heard of the language, but its uses could justify why redditors think so highly of this language. From Hackernoon, one of the advantages of Go is the ease of use. [^8] Since its syntax is as simple as Java or Python, Go is considered another language easy to learn and implement right away. However, this is also a flaw since one of the best advantages is its worst disadvantage: too simplistic. The simplicity of Go limits its usage, making high-level functional program more difficult to create than more complex languages that could do more with less lines. Since Go's best advantage is also its worst disadvantage, it's sentiment score could be explained by redditors agreeing that Go is good for some programs but not the best overall. 

SQL as a a "great" programming language definitely makes sense, but it is at the bottom of the greats. Rather than looking at the advantages and disadvantages, the applications of SQL might better explain its sentiment score. Geekforgeeks talk about how SQL is widely used in the Business Intelligence tool, data manipulation and data testing are done through SQL, data dcience tools depend highly on SQL, and big data tools such as Spark, Impala are dependent on SQL.[^9] As we can see from these applications, SQL is mostly a database and data centered language. Since there is not much use of SQL outside of using data, SQL is a very limited language. However, data centered programs and applications are definitely still large and very much needed so the need for using SQL is also massive. This most likely contributes to redditor's opinions on SQL. SQL's popularity makes the score positively high, but its usage with primarily data manipulation definitely limits the score from being ranked higher.

### The Middle Languages (Good Positive Sentiments)
In the next level down, Perl, Java, and Swift are considered to be in the "good" range based on their sentiment score from redditors and my personal ranking system. 

Perl as a programming language is essentially unknown to me since I have neither heard of it nor used it in my life. However, it's popularity and usage must be functional and good enough to be in this ranking. Perl includes powerful program languages, has high complexity, is open source, and is efficient at text processing. However, Perl is also difficult to fix bugs, and not intended for any web development and web engineering. [^10] The advantage of being able to handle text processing makes it very useful in network programs, information and database centered programs, and possibly financial or business analysis programs. Perl's use in other fields rather than just the technology field could extend it popularity and its positive outlook, making it one of the good programming languages to redditors since it has so much capability and usage.

Java's score puts in the highest ranking for "good" but why is it only good and not great? Java's advntages include simplicity, object oriented based, secure, economical to maintain, platform independent, high-level, portability, automatic garbage, multi-threading, stable, distributed, and efficient memory. Java's disadvantages, however, somewhat outweigh its advantages. Java has a slow and poor performance, poor GUI, lack of backup functionaility, usage of large memory space, complex code, and more recently, paid commercial licensing.[^11] Java is used in many applications, especially software applications and gaming applications (specifically Minecraft comes to mind), making it one of the popular go-to languages for creating applications due to its portability as well. However, with it's disadvantages, it is also clear to see why it is not as positively viewed as the other languages on this list. Even the Minecraft team, mentioned before, had to create a separate "game" that was Minecraft coded using C++ rather than Java to work with cross-platform compability and overall better efficiency and performance of the game. It is very likely that redditors on the Java subreddit talk about much of the negatives of Java, including the new license that needs to be purchased to utilize Java commercially. Java's score is definitely justifed by the disadvantages it has.

Swift's score puts the language second to last in the overall ranking. Swift is primariy used on only MacOS to develop IOS applications. This makes Swift very limited since many android or Windows user would not touch much of Swift. Swift's limited use makes it a difficult language to work with since the actual syntax is also difficult at times and the community is not as large as other programming languages. Combined with the fact that Swift is the newest language out of all of the languages in this ranking, Swift has potential to achieve a higher score possibly in a few years with changes, but it does not change the fact that its limits to Apple related software and Apple's operating system restricts the community and creates a smaller pool of redditors to talk about the language positively. 

### What Redditors Think VERSUS What Other Online Presences Think?
With the previous discussions of the programming languages in this ranking, their sentiment scores reflect the views of redditors on the subreddit of that language. However, another interesting question to explore is what other sources rank programming languages. 

Searchable Design's article talks about the 10 most "disliked" programming languages. The languages discussed in my ranking that appeared in this article are Perl, Ruby, C++, and Java. What's interesting is the comparison with their rankings and the rankings in this discussion. Java was rated number 9 disliked while Java was number 8 liked (or number 4 disliked if we go backwards using my ranking). If we compare scales, this is somewhat similar despite being different numbers. The article believe Java was only #9 disliked while my ranking saw Java as being #8 liked so Java definitely has potential. C++ and Ruby was ranked #8 and #7 disliked respectively in the article. Compared to my ranking, C++ was #4 liked and Ruby was number #10 liked. C++ and Ruby did have its aforementioned flaws and issues, so possible Searchable Design used their flaws as a justfiable reason for their rankings. Lastly, Perl was rated #3 disliked while Perl was #7 liked on my list. This is a drastic change since Perl did better than Java, Swift, and JavaScript in my ranking yet the article talks about how Perl is old and inferior to python.[^12] Interestingly enough, I would agree with some of the articles rankings more than the findings from the sentiment scores, but the sentiment scores are values that do not lie.

In another article by UC Berkeley[^13], they talked about the 11 most in demand programming languages. Surprisingly, JavaScript was first on their list while JavaScript was last on mine. This might be because JavaScript is in demand, but people do not have positive views on it on reddit. Python was #2, HTML was #3, Java was #5, SQL was #6, Rust was #9, Perl was #10, and Go was #11. Compared to my rankings, UC Berkeley somewhat agreed with some of the languages in the same general vicinity (off by one of two ranking values), but the order is different from my findings with sentiment scores. Again, similar to the other article, I agree with UC Berkeley's ranking a bit more than the sentiment scores, but the sentiment scores do show that redditors views of programming languages differ from public eye. 

### Final Thoughts / Possible Further Exploration
After analyzing and researching these different programming languages, I can conclude that the sentiment analysis I did showed some interesting results about the languages and what redditors thought of them. On Reddit, Python was most popular while UC Berkeley disagrees and thinks JavaScript is most important, which is at the bottom of my list. It's possible that my sentiment analysis had its own flaws due to only searching the past 1000 posts from the past year. 

Further interesting questions to explore in a possible future project could include the following:
* What would the scores and rankings be if all posts of all time were analyzed instead of only the hottest 1000 from the past year?
* If a different sentiment analysis dictionary was used, would sentiment analysis differ and my interpretation of scores be different?
* What would be the most accurate way to analyze Redditor's true views on these programming languages?
* If we looked at one specific programming language specifically, could we analyze the words of posts and determine how many posts individually are overall positive, negative, or neutral? Would that better help place the programming language in the right ranking?
